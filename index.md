## Hello!

I am an undergraduate at Brooklyn College and expect to graduate with a B.S. in Computer Science by January 2020. The curriculum has allowed me develop a strong understanding of data structures and algorithms with the use of Java and C++, which I have further reinforced by practicing problem solving in Python using an online platform.

Though sitting down at a cafe and working on a program is something I really enjoy doing, a big part of why I like to program is that it allows me to fulfill a desire to create and innovate. My goal as a software engineer is to solve problems for a larger purpose while enjoying the luxury of doing something I love.

In the few weeks as a research intern at University of Massachusetts Lowell, I was able to have a peek at various security vulnerabilities and the several solutions the research team was able to conceive. I had a chance to debug a scrambled Android keyboard which protected users from attacks using video recordings which recorded login credentials from afar. I was also able to test a Bluetooth hijacking project which traced the trajectory of an unencrypted Bluetooth mouse to record a graphical user password.

I hope to join a team where I can contribute directly to these solutions and to be able to learn as much as possible as a software engineer.
