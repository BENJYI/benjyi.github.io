## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="benport.png">

Hello,

I am currently studying for my B.S. degree in Computer Science at Brooklyn College. The expected graduation date is May 2020. As I am very close to finishing my curriculum, I hope to find an internship at a company that will acclimate me to the tech industry and allow me to mature as a software engineer. In the past semesters, some notable programming courses I have taken are algorithms, data structures, software design, software development, operating systems, and computer architecture.

As for my experience in programming, most of my courses have required me to learn Java, Python, and C/C++. But, I have spent some of my spare time learning to build mobile and web applications, most of which has gone into learning Objective-C and Swift using the Cocoa framework.
