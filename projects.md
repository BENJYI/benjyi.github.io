## Gemini - iOS Mobile Game

Repository: [https://github.com/BENJYI/Gemini/](https://github.com/BENJYI/Gemini)

A full set of Mahjong tiles are laid out on the board as a 16x9 grid. The player must match two identical tiles given the following set of rules:
1. Two tiles can be matched if they are the same characters and no other tiles are in between the two tiles. Adjacent tiles can always be matched.
2. If a tile a matched, they are removed from the board.
3. A tile can be used as a focal point to push a group of tiles through empty space on the board. If the tile can be matched after displacement, the tiles are given their new positions. Otherwise, the displacement is reversed.

## Too Many Cooks - Web Application

Repository: [https://github.com/BENJYI/too_many_cooks](https://github.com/BENJYI/too_many_cooks)

This was a final team project for my Software Engineering course. The goal of the project was to display practical knowledge of entity-relationship and use case models by creating a food delivery system with proper documentation. To create both ends, we used Rails to scaffold the project. The final product had a login system with authentication allowing a user to function as a customer, chef, delivery personnel, or a manager, each having unique functionality - customers can order food, chefs can produce the orders, delivery personnel can delivery the orders, and managers can hire or fire employees. For documentation, we wrote a system design report, which is viewable in the repository or <a href="https://github.com/BENJYI/too_many_cooks/blob/master/SDR.pdf">here</a>.

## JPM Chase Code for Good Hackathon - iOS Mobile Application

Repository: [https://github.com/brooklyn2016/team-21](https://github.com/brooklyn2016/team-21)

In this Hackathon, several non-profit organizations presented problems that needed solving. As a randomly organized group of four students, we had 24-hours to produce a strategy which solved one of these problems. We chose to create a mobile application for the organization <a href="https://eden2.org/">Eden II</a>, which helped the autistic community through several extracurricular programs. The application functioned as a medium of communication between caretakers and clients who sometimes used unrecognizable words. The application allowed Eden II to hold a database of words specific to a unique client as a reference for the staff to use in order to communicate with a particular individual.
